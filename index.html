        <h1>Inkwall's HtmlArea</h1>

<p>This is Inkwall's HtmlArea. Here's what I hope you find:</p>

<ol>
<li>Super easy to use. I want to step out of the pattern of Office 95 wannabes, without making you have to think twice about how to do something.</li>
<li>Lightweight. You shouldn't have to wait for lots of files to load up when all you want to do is fix a typo in your blog post. HtmlArea should stay out of your way.</li>
<li>Extensible. If you are blogger on Inkwall, you probably don't care at all, but I had a terrible experience trying to reskin and add features to other editors, and I don't want other programmer to have to go through that.
While I certainly hope it works for you, I don't aim for the broad compatibility many editors claim. If you aren't using the latest version of a popular browser, you have bigger problems to worry about than any bug you find in HtmlArea.</li>
</ol><p><em>I'm not done yet.</em></p>

<p>While I'm excited about what I've got so far, the best is yet to come. If you find problems, let me know about it. Also, let me know what you'd like to see. Here's what Dennis and I have in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Select from preset styles, so you can focus on your content, while we make it look good.</li>
</ul><h2>Specifics</h2>

<h3>Browser Compatibility</h3>

<p>If you find a bug in HtmlArea while using the latest version of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Internet Explorer, I'd like to fix it... perhaps Opera if the bug is nasty, and you ask me real nice like.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>HtmlArea has no external dependencies. The code base is in vanilla javascript.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
